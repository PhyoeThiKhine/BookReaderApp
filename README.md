Implementation Details:

The Book Finder App was developed using the following technologies and methodologies:

Programming Language:	[C++]

User Interface Design:	[Qt Framework, Qt Creator]

Google Books API Integration: 	The BookFinder App utilizes the Google Books API to access a vast database of books, enabling                          users to search for books based on various criteria such as title, author, ISBN, or keywords.

Scraping and Data Retrieval:		The app employs scraping techniques to fetch relevant data from the Google Books API. It sends requests to the API, retrieves JSON responses, and extracts essential information about books, including their titles, authors, publication dates, descriptions, and cover images.

JSON Parsing and Data Processing:		The BookFinder App incorporates robust JSON parsing logic to efficiently extract     relevant      information from the API responses. It handles the parsing of complex JSON structures and organizes the retrieved data into manageable objects for further processing.

Search Functionality:		The app provides users with a user-friendly search interface where they can enter their search queries. It then sends the requests to the Google Books API, retrieves matching results, and presents them to the users.

Data Presentation:	BookFinder offers multiple formats for presenting the book data to cater to different user preferences. It can display search results in a list view, providing essential details such as book title, author, and publication date. Additionally, users can access detailed views for individual books, including descriptions, cover images, and additional metadata.

User-Friendly Interface: 	The app aims to provide a seamless user experience with an intuitive and visually appealing interface. It employs modern design principles, making it easy for users to navigate, search for books, and explore the retrieved data effortlessly.
